 ADO_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "The 1933 revolution, though unsuccessful, sparked new political ideas that continue to spread among the Andorran people. The brief rise of Boris I, the self-proclaimed King of Andorra, added to the instability, leaving the country uncertain about its future.\n\nSmall and agricultural, yet taking its first steps toward industrialization, Andorra remains officially neutral. However, with tensions rising in neighboring Spain and France, its unique political system—under the joint rule of the French president and the Catalan bishop is increasingly questioned. Will it endure, or is change inevitable?"
 ADO_BLITZKRIEG_DESC: "With the end of the Spanish Civil War, Andorra finds itself in a fragile position. The tiny principality had served as a refuge for those fleeing the brutal conflict, but now, as Franco consolidates power in Spain, the future remains uncertain.\n\nThough neutral and isolated, Andorra is not untouched by the shifting tides of Europe. Andorra's unique political system, still under the joint rule of France and the Catalan bishop, may soon face challenges greater than ever before. Will the nation remain a quiet observer, or will the coming war force it into a new era?"
